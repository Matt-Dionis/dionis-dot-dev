I wrote my first line of code at age 30 and haven't stopped since! Before beginning my career as an engineer I worked as an actuarial technician, data analyst, fitness model, and an investigator under top-secret security clearance. It's been quite a ride.

In my free time I enjoy relaxing with my wife, daughter, and two chihuahuas, training as a powerlifter, and creating content to make web development more approachable for a broader segment of creators.

I'm a GraphQL fanatic and also love building with modern JavaScript, specifically React and VueJS.
